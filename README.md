OCR test
========

A PDF of scanned romanian text along with the text extracted by two OCR tools.
ABBYY Finereader 9 for Linux, which is trialware with a limitation of 100 pages or commercial, seems to do a good job.
Tesseract,  which is probably the best free software OCR tool has a much lower accuracy. With some extra training or with better quality TIFF made from the PDF it may get better. Let's see :)
The tools were called as seen in the ocr.sh shell script.
